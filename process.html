													<p>I believe that the purest creative process is <strong>visceral</strong>, at least at the beginning it is.</p>
													<p>The problem with Guts is its lack of sensitivity, that's why you need Heart. It balances the strength of Guts with <strong>feelings</strong>. Then, what you have is a bunch of precious but unstable ideas that need Brain to make sense in the real world.</p>
													<p>It's a good a idea if Brain stays in control from that moment, but it never should forget about Guts and Heart, as the three of them find <strong>balance</strong>.</p>

											<h2>The UX process</h2>
											<div class="row">
												<div class="6u 12u$(medium) center">
													<p>If I had to pick a concept I learned during my training in UX, is this one: <strong>trust the process!</strong> Even when you feel lost, as long as you trust the process everything will be fine. Everything will come together sooner or later.</p>
													<p>It's all about finding what <strong>stands out</strong>, whether it is in a good or a bad way. Then, find a balance.</p>
													<p>It takes patience, empathy and some practice, but improving experiences is always a rewarding activity.</p>

											<h2>Evaluation and analysis</h2>
											<div class="row">
												<div class="6u 12u$(medium)">
													<img class="illustration" src="./images/process2.png" alt=""><p></p>
												</div>
												<div class="6u 12u$(medium) center">
													<p></p>
													<p>In order to understand users better than they understand themselves, it's necessary to <strong>understand</strong> the market first.</p>
													<p>The first step to achieve that is the competitive analysis. Being aware of who the direct and indirect <strong>competitors</strong> are raises awareness of the position of the company.</p>
													<p>Identifying the <strong>strengths and weaknesses</strong> of the competitors always helps to focus on the features that make a product great and forget about those that are dispensable.</p>
												</div>
											</div>

												<hr />
											<h2>User research</h2>
											<div class="row">
												<div class="6u 12u$(medium) center">
													<p>The user research makes the project real. Talking to users is always interesting and surprising.</p>
													<p>But as we all know in this industry, there is not such thing as the average user. That's why the UX tools are so important. Looking for patterns, pointing out key findings and interesting quotes, the creation of personas and storyboards help us empathise with that abstract but existing thing that <strong>the user</strong> is.</p>
													<p>And, of course, it's also good <strong>fun!</strong></p>

											<h2>Information architecture</h2>
											<div class="row">
												<div class="6u 12u$(medium)">
													<img class="illustration" src="./images/process4.jpg" alt=""><p></p>
												</div>
												<div class="6u 12u$(medium) center">
													<p>The next step is to put together all the information and get some conclusions that can be translated into an actual solution.</p>
													<p>The definition of the <strong>problem statement</strong> and the solution are not as easy as they can seem. However, a good definition of the problem can solve a project.</p>
													<p>Techniques such as information architecture, mental and affinity mapping and feature prioritisation may require loads of post-its but they are always <strong>enlightening</strong>.</p>
												</div>
											</div>

												<hr />

											<h2>Iterative design</h2>
											<div class="row">
												<div class="6u 12u$(medium) center">
													<p>Once the ideas have been organised and the solution is clear, it's time to start making it tangible! Running a <strong>design studio</strong> with other people involved in the project, as designers, developers and stakeholders, gives the opportunity of collecting different points of view that can be key in order to find the best solution.</p>
													<p>First rapid <strong>sketches</strong> and paper prototypes are useful to have the first contact with the product and test the structure and the navigation in a quick and cheap way. Besides, it has a friendly look and it's enjoyable for users. While testing, it's important to make the user feel safe, as they will give us more useful insights if they feel free to speak.</p>
													<p>When the basic structure passes the <strong>usability testing</strong>, it's time to go digital. Testing the usability between iterations and keeping a good file management system guarantees the success of the project.</p>

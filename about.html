							<h2>Who I am</h2>
							<div class="row">
							<div class="6u 12u$(medium) center">
								<p>I'm a UX Designer with a background in Industrial Design and photo manipulation. My passion is to use visual tools to make people <strong>feel</strong> and think in new ways.</p>
								<p>I love learning <strong>new</strong> skills. I don't have problems delegating work to others, but I like to feel able to do it myself if needed. That's why I only use my own pictures to illustrate this website.</p>
								<p>I have always enjoyed solving problems of <strong>daily life</strong> and I love working with my hands as well as with a computer.</p>

							<h2>What I have done</h2>
							<div class="row">
								<div class="6u 12u$(medium)"><img class="illustration" src="./images/about1.jpg" alt=""><p></p></div>
							<div class="6u 12u$(medium) center">
								<p>I've worked in advertising and multimedia. I've done a few photographic exhibitions and I've been an artisan and a baker, among other things.</p>
								<p>This <strong>sinuous</strong> experience has given me a general understanding of the world, from the emotional reaction that arises when a need is not covered, through the process of finding and developing the solution, until the end of the lifecycle.</p>
								<p>I decided to start a career in <strong>UX</strong> because this discipline puts together all the skills that I have been developing throughout my life.</p>

							<h2>What I want to do</h2>
							<div class="row">
							<div class="6u 12u$(medium)">
									<p>I'm always open to new <strong>challenges</strong> and I love learning new things. I enjoy working hard when I know that what I do makes a difference in people's lives.</p>
									<p>I would like to work with people who put the user first and <strong>believe</strong> in what they do, so they are always willing to do a great job in any circumstance.</p>
									<p>I would love to be surrounded by amazing professionals who are aware of themselves and others and are <strong>not afraid</strong> of trying new things.</p>
